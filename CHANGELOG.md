## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial package scaffold: root Swift package, namespacing under `PureXML`, and
  the portability and verification gates carried over from PureYAML.
- XML node model (`PureXML.Model`): `Node`, `Element`, `Attribute`, and
  `QualifiedName`, preserving document order and node kinds.
- XML emitter (`PureXML.Emitting.Serializer`) with pretty-printed and compact
  output and correct text and attribute escaping.
- Structural validation (`PureXML.Validation.Validator`) for duplicate attribute
  names.
- Streaming, iterative XML parser. `PureXML.Parsing.EventReader` is a pull-based
  event core that consumes input through a character-source closure and emits one
  `Event` at a time, holding only bounded state (an open-element stack and a small
  lookahead buffer). It never requires the whole document in memory and can drive
  chunked input. `PureXML.Parsing.Parser` builds a `Model.Node` tree iteratively
  over the event core (no recursion). Handles elements, attributes, text, the five
  predefined entities and numeric character references, comments, CDATA, and
  processing instructions. Safe by default: `<!DOCTYPE>` is rejected (no DTD/XXE).
- Top-level API: `PureXML.parse(_:)`, `PureXML.parse(pulling:)`, and
  `PureXML.events(_:)` / `PureXML.events(pulling:)` for streaming.
